Generate a practice version of the Python solution for the following LLM implementation problem:

**PROBLEM**: {GENERATED_PROBLEM}

Requirements for Practice Solution:
- Provide a Python skeleton with key functions and structure
- Include helpful hints without giving away the complete solution
- Add TODO comments for students to fill in
- Focus on learning objectives and key LLM concepts
- Make it challenging but achievable for practice
- Include step-by-step guidance
- Provide executable Python code structure with placeholders

Output Format (JSON):
{{
  "title": "Practice Python Solution",
  "code": "```python\n# Python skeleton with TODOs and hints\n# Include imports and basic structure\n# Add TODO comments for key implementation points\n# Include helpful hints in comments\n# Provide example usage structure\n```",
  "hints": ["hint1", "hint2", "hint3", "hint4"],

}}

Guidelines:
- Create a learning-focused Python version that guides without solving
- Include strategic hints that lead students to the solution
- Add TODO comments for key implementation points
- Provide learning objectives to focus the practice
- Include common mistakes to help students avoid pitfalls
- Make the Python code structure clear but leave implementation details
- Include resources for further learning
- Balance challenge with achievability
- Focus on LLM implementation concepts
- Provide executable Python skeleton with proper imports
